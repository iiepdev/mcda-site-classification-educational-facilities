# Multi-criteria decision analysis for site classification of educational facilities

The code and documents included in this repository is linked to the paper Site Classification of Educational Facilities and Infrastructure, by Gagnon, Vargas Mesa, & Sheldon (forthcoming), in a joint publication between IIEP-UNESCO and UNOSAT. Part A of this paper aims at showcasing a methodology to perform a customized classification of educational facilities according to a context-relevant hazard risk index. Part B (which will be added to this repository in the future), includes a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the suitability of land to have new schools.
